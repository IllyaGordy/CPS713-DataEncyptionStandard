CPS713-DataEncyptionStandard
============================

A mini Data Encryption Standard system

Description of the Assignment: 
<b>Background</b>: The main purpose of this lab is for you to gain hands-on experience in the basic cryptographic algorithms covered in class, in par- ticular block ciphers such as Data Encryption Standard (DES). The block cipher to be used for this lab is described below and referred to as Mini-DES (m-DES).
